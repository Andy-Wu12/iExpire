## Installation

**I am not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program and due to that, lack the option to distribute this app in the App Store.** 

However, you can 
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in XCode
3. Connect your Apple device to your computer with the device's charging cable.
4. Build the app, which XCode should then automatically install on your device and run.
    - You might need to enable "Developer Mode" on your device first, which you can read about [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device)
